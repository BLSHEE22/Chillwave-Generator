# Chillwave Generator
An engine that randomly generates chillwave music.

The "randomMusic.circ" file is intended to be opened in Logisim-evolution (https://github.com/kevinawalsh/logisim-evolution).

The MIPS instructions - "randomMusicMipsCode.txt" - should then be loaded into the circuit.

Further instructions are listed inside the circuit!
